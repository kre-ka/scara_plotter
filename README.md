# SCARA Plotter

This piece of software makes (or will make, as it's a WIP) [SCARA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCARA) robotic arm draw shapes defined by splines. Made in C for STM32 microcontroller (not yet integrated).

## Why SCARA

Cartesian would be better, but SCARA is cooler, and it's most of all a fun project.

## Inner machinations

TODO, for now just follow comments in [main.c](src/main.c).

## TODO
- make TODO list
